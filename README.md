For this final assignment you have to describe a real-life scenario of Bangladesh in one or two pages. Please note that any resemblance of this scenario with another submission will result to marks deduction for both parties. Please note that, for this assignment, assume that everything has to be in main memory, the system runs 24/7 and you donâ€™t need to save anything in the disk. You are strictly instructed to not to share your scenario with anyone. Also, try to make your scenario very unique (for example, a software to implement the boat riding system in Hatir Jheel, a software to manage the traffic systems in Bashundhara, etc.) An example scenario (although not unique and not even a page long) is given below:




Example:

A village library wants to develop a Library Management System for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. This library management system gives us the complete information about the library and the daily transactions done in a Library.




We need to maintain the record of news and retrieve the details of books available in the library which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new member, new books, and up new information, searching books and members and facility to borrow and return books.




It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive user interface, combined with strong searching, insertion and reporting capabilities. The report generation facility of library system helps to get a good idea of which books are borrowed by the members, makes users possible to generate hard copy.




The following are the brief description on the functions achieved through this system: by the end users:

<ul>

 <li>Librarian: To maintain and update the records and also to cater the needs of the users.</li>

 <li>Reader: Need books to read and also places various requests to the librarian.</li>

 <li>Vendor: To provide and meet the requirement of the prescribed books</li>

</ul>




<strong>[In Two to three Pages]: </strong>

Then, you have to write the name of the data structures that you think should be used to implement the scenario. You should also describe shortly why you think that those data structures are suitable candidates to be used for your solution. The description of used data structures should use two to three pages.




Example:

For the scenario described above, the following data structures can be used:




<ol>

 <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> &lt;Why do you need it (to implement what?). You need to justify why you have chosen it. For example, why Binary Search Tree, why not Array.&gt;</li>

</ol>

<em>For the given scenario, you can use BST to search a book from the digital catalogue when user looks for a specific book and you can provide him the shelf no or isle number to get the book.  </em>

<ol start="2">

 <li><strong>Queue:</strong> &lt;Why do you need it (to implement what?). Justification?&gt; <em>You can use it to generate a on screen waiting list of the customers/readers/users of your library who are at the library and waiting in a line to talk to you. </em></li>

 <li><strong>Stack:</strong> &lt;Why do you need it (to implement what?). Justification?&gt;</li>

 <li><strong>Graph:</strong> &lt;Why do you need it (to implement what?). Justification?&gt;</li>

 <li><strong>Ordered List:</strong> &lt;Why do you need it (to implement what?). Justification?&gt;</li>

 <li><strong>..</strong></li>

</ol>
